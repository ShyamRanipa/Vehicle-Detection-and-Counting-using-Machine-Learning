This project implements a real-time vehicle detection and counting system using Python, OpenCV, and traditional computer vision techniques. It is designed to monitor vehicle flow in video streams for traffic analysis and urban planning.

Features:
- Object detection using background subtraction and contour analysis
- Region of Interest (ROI) based vehicle counting
- Real-time frame processing and bounding box visualization
- Classification of vehicles by direction and size (if applicable)

Tech Stack:
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

Use Case:
Useful for traffic monitoring, smart city infrastructure, and intelligent transportation systems (ITS).

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:
Helps automate vehicle count analysis and visualize traffic density using video data from surveillance systems.
